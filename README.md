Do you use a Linux Distribution that isn't support by Discord? Do you hate having to wait for your Linux Distribution to update Discord?

Then check out my project here, because you are in the same boat as me!

## How to install

Run this command in your Linux Terminal: `sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheKamboy/easy-discord-updater/master/install.sh -O -)"`
